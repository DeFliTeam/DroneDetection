**Abstract**

Drones are widely used in the energy, construction, agriculture, transportation, warehousing,real estate and movie industries. Key applications include
surveys, inspections, deliveries and cinematography. Withapproximately 70-80% of the global market share of commercial off-the-shelf drones, Da-Jiang Innovations
(DJI), headquartered in Shenzhen, China, essentially monopolizes the drone market. As commercial-off-the-shelfdrone sales steadily rise, the Federal Aviation
Administration has instituted regulations to protect the federal airspace. DJI has become a pioneer in developing remote identification technology in the form of drone ID
(also known as AeroScope signals). Despite claims from the company touting its implementation of drone ID technology as “encrypted” yet later being proved incorrect for the
claim. DeFli Network's Drone Detection program shows a methodology for obtaining drone signals from all leading manufacturers, including DJI, Parrot and Skydio as well as 
any other manufacturer that is compliant with RemoteID configuration by virtue of listing their broadcast beacon with IEE 802.11. 

The aim of a widespread drone detection network built on low cost SDR receivers and open-source software is to offer ground based users a cost effective methodology of tracking 
drones without being forced to acquire the $20,000 DJI Aeroscope. The data received is also partitioned in to the DeFli UTM. 

**Background to Drone ID** 

Civilian unmanned aerial vehicles, also known asdrones, are commercial-off-the-shelf products that havegained popularity over the years. The Federal Aviation
Administration estimates that commercial-off-the-shelf drone sales rose from 2.5 million in 2016 to 7 million in 2020. 

The Federal Aviation Administration is charged by the Code of Federal Regulations to be the ultimate arbiter in civil aviation regulation. Specifically, the Federal
Aviation Administration oversees Title 14, Chapter 1 in the Code of Federal Regulations, which has two parts that cover drones. Part 107 contains regulations that govern
small drones. Part 89 contains remote identification requirements for small drones. 

Due to the increased operation of drones, the Federal Aviation Administration has instituted regulations to protect the federal airspace. The regulations cover
documented authorization, flight operating limitations and remote identification requirements. A key regulation is that, after September 16, 2023, drones that do not comply
with the remote identification reporting requirements may not be operated in federal airspace. 

Remote identification, which is implemented by drones broadcasting vehicle and flight data once every second, enables the Federal Aviation Administration, law
enforcement and other federal agencies to properly identify vehicles and their ground stations. Remoteidentification of a drone is implemented using messages
containing specific data elements that are emitted by the vehicle when it is turned on. The messages must be broadcasted once per second. 

Table 1 shows the remote identification elements and performance requirements from Section 305 and Section 310 in Title 14, Chapter 1, Part 89 in the Code of Federal
Regulations. The remote identification elements are prioritized so that aviation and law enforcement authorities can quickly and accurately identify persons
who misuse drones.
The drone serial number and session identifier are unique tags set by the manufacturer. Manufacturers mayincorporate the serial number or session identifier, or both,
in broadcast messages. The longitude and latitude data points of the controller must be encoded cryptographicallybefore broadcasting. The controller altitude must be the
most precise measurement reported; the measurement must have a margin of error no more than 15 feet. The timestamp in the message must be synchronized within
one second with all other data elements from the time of broadcast. The broadcast message must also have some form of error correction embedded.
The elements are emitted by an internal broadcasting module in the drone. However, if a manufacturer decides to create its own external broadcasting module, the module
does not have to report controller location and altitude information. The Federal Aviation Administration finalauthority states that a drone may not take off if the
elements in Table 1 are not included in its broadcast messages.

**DJI** 

With approximately 70-80% of the global commercial off-the-shelf drone business, Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI), headquartered in Shenzhen, China, essentially monopolizes the drone market. DJI releases several
new drone models every year. The models are typically used in three drone applications: video production, enterprise activities and agricultural solutions.
A DJI drone currently employs one of two proprietary communications protocols, Enhanced Wi-Fi and OcuSync

1. Enhanced Wi-Fi Protocol: The Enhanced Wi-Fi protocol is used by older DJI Spark and Mavic Air models. The protocol transmission range is limited to visual line of sight.

2. OcuSync Protocol: The OcuSync protocol is used by the DJI Mavic series, Air series and Mini series of drones. This new DJI protocol, which leverages
software-defined radio technology, has a protocol transmission range of approximately 2.5 miles.

The Lightbridge protocol was the first protocol DJI implemented and was used in older DJI Phantom series, Inspire series and Matrice series of drones. 

DJI also markets drone monitoring systems that leverage the remote identification functionality mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that
drones are operated safely. In 2017, DJI released AeroScope monitoring systems that can identify most DJI drones (Lightbridge, Enhanced Wi-Fi and OcuSync
drones).

The latest DJI AeroScope drone monitoring systems can identify up to 50 DJI drone models [4]. DJI markets these systems as ideal for placement at or near airports, prisons,
nuclear power plants, government facilities and critical infrastructure assets. The RRP of these devices is close to $20,000 and it is therefore this industry that the DeFli Drone Detection Network 
intends to disrupt. 

A DJI AeroScope monitoring system captures and stores telemetry data of all the drones it monitors as well as their serial numbers and GPS data, return-to-home GPS
data and controller (pilot) GPS data. The unique user identification code (UUID) associated with the purchaser of a drone is also recorded. DJI has confirmed that the
UUID ties a drone pilot to a registered DJI user account. Thus, DJI can query UUIDs to obtain pilot names, email addresses, even credit card numbers and related
data. Law enforcement agencies requesting UUID information may be granted personal identifiable information regarding the drone owner. 

**Remote Identification on Advanced WiFi** 

Department 13, a company specializing drone countermeasures, discovered operational details about drone remote identification packets by examining an accidental release of DJI’s Mavic Pro drone firmware. The
discovery is documented in a white paper that provides the only publicly available information about DJI remote identification frames sent with Enhanced Wi-Fi drones
(Department 13, Anatomy of DJI’s Drone Identification Implementation, White Paper, Canberra, Australia, 2017.).

DJI drone remote identification packets are incorporated in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi beacon management frames. The 802.11 Wi-Fi beacon management frames are
designed to announce the existence of vehicles (M. Gast, 802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, O’Reilly Media, Sebastopol, California, 2005). 

Fig. 2 shows the 802.11 beacon management frame structure Enhanced Wi-Fi drones emit. The frame control field
specifies the frame type and subtype; setting the type to 0 and subtype to 8 informs the network that the frame is a beacon. The device address, sender address and basic
service set identifier (BSS ID) fields are arbitrary. The frame body contains various information elements. The information elements provide the network with detailed
information about access points. The service set identifier (SSID) field, supported rates field and current channel field are included in the frame.

Appended to an 802.11 Wi-Fi beacon management frame is a DJI drone payload. Fig. 3 discovered in the decompiled code of the ath6kl_usb.ko firmware
kernel module shows the structure of the payload [8]. The kernel module directly controls the Atheros wireless network adapter in the drone. In the code snippet, the
payload preamble is a unique series of eight bytes concatenated (via memcpy) to the flight_info packet.
After the dji_ie_on parameter is set, the drone begins to emit a 76-byte remote identification packet via the Atheros wireless network adapter.

**Occusync Drone Identification** 

In 2022, an open-source effort was initiated to demodulate DJI OcuSync drone ID signals (www.github.com/proto17/dji_droneid). The repository revealed that OcuSync drone IDs are loosely
based on some Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular standards. This means any software defined radio (SDR) capable of sampling up to 15,360,000 samples per second
(the LTE sample rate) up to a bandwidth of 10 MHz cancapture OcuSync drone IDs.

Fig. 4 shows a GNU Radio flow graph leveraging a LimeSDR to see DJI drone ID signals in real-time (via afosophor sink). Any SDR capable of sampling 32-bit
floating point IQ data (.fc32 file) up to 15.35 MSPS can use this GNU Radio flow graph and capturing drone ID signals. Fig. 5 shows the waterfall output from the GNU
radio flow graph with a drone ID highlighted. 

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zf1kk4t/Screenshot-from-2023-10-09-15-18-46.png" alt="Screenshot-from-2023-10-09-15-18-46" border="0"></a>

With a capable SDR, a successful capture must be tuned to center frequencies broadcasted by drone ID signals. Table 2 shows center frequencies in the 2.4 GHz
and 5.8 GHz frequency bands that drone IDs are found on.

This data was collected by leaving several DJI Mavic models with the power on. The 2.4 GHz frequency band ranges from 2399.5 MHz to 2474.5 MHz, and the 5.8 GHz
frequency band ranges from 5741.5 MHz to 5831.5 MHz. It was also discovered that even if a user forces the DJIOcuSync communications downlink to be 2.4 GHz or 5
GHz with the DJI GO smartphone application, DJI drone ID signals do not adhere and continue to broadcast out-of-band from the communications link. 

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fSDPv5n/Screenshot-from-2023-10-09-15-20-32.png" alt="Screenshot-from-2023-10-09-15-20-32" border="0"></a> 

A signal broadcasts on a frequency until 12-20 drone IDs emit before hopping. Fig. 6 shows a sample DJI Mavic Pro drone ID signal. A drone ID signal is approximately
600 milliseconds in duration. 

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gZy7V79/Screenshot-from-2023-10-09-15-21-31.png" alt="Screenshot-from-2023-10-09-15-21-31" border="0"></a> 

A drone ID signal contains nine OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) symbols. Sometimes, drone ID signals contain eight OFDM symbols. However,demodulation only needs eight OFDM symbols as the first
symbol in a nine OFDM system can be discarded.
The first and last OFDM symbols are sized 80 and the middle symbols are sized 72 (e.g., ([80, 72, 72, 72, 72, 72, 72, 72, 80]). Once captured, DJI drone ID signals can be demodulated using digital signal processing. The
demodulation steps are provided in the dji_droneid GitHub repository and are the following

1. Identifying the start of a drone ID
2. Creating a low-pass bandwidth filter
3. Applying a coarse frequency offset correction
4. OFDM symbol extraction (sans cyclic prefixes)
5. Measuring channel impulse rate
6. Quantizing Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK)into bits
7. Descrambling bits
8. Turbo decoder and rate matcher
9. Deframing bytes 

The demodulation steps are converted into Python. The proceeding algorithms in the DeFli DroneDetetction are outlined step by step in Pythonic pseudocode in this (repo). 

**Drone Detection on DeFli** 

*Ocusync Detection* 

A DJI OcuSync detection system runs effectively using “cheap” SDRs (under $500) such as AirSpy R2's coupled with an Intel-based processor computer to
process the Python script and turbo decoder program. 

OcuSync drone ID demodulation steps and logic have already been discussed in (this) repo but monitoring a DJI drone on the fly requires real-time
detection capabilities with reliable radio frequency throughput. Rapid frequency hopping on known center frequencies (via Table 2) is also necessary to maximize
success rates. 

Alg. 2 can be outfitted to include a dynamic cross correlation that is constantly scanning for drone IDs. The @njit decorator in Numba, a high-performance Python
compiler, can aid in faster calculations and yields better performance benchmarks when applied to the cross correlation function.
The tradeoff with low-cost SDRs (e.g., AIRSPY R2 ) is unreliable crystal oscillators which occasionally invoke frequency offsets. These offsets can result in failed
demodulations. However, there are ways to calculate a frequency offset at any juncture and apply a correction toa capture. The best solution found for a AIRSPY R2 is
using the CellSearch program in the LTE-Cell-Scanner GitHub repository (www.github.com/JiaoXianjun/LTE-Cell-Scanner). 

Alg. 10 leverages the CellSearch program to ping nearby LTE bands (stored in lteBand) from a range of frequencies: a frequency minimum (freqMin) to a
frequency maximum (freqMax). The program can measure the crystal frequency error of the LTE frequency (crystalCorrection). The crystalCorrection is then
transformed into a ppm number with a simple equation. 

Algorithm 10: Correction of Airspy R2 frequency offset.
Input: freqBand: Nearby frequency band
Output: ppm: HackRF crystal oscillator error
lteBand ← {1: [2140, 2140.1]…103: [757.5, 757.6]}
freqMin ← lteBand[freqBand][0]
freqMax ← lteBand[freqBand][1]
crystalCorrection ← CellSearch(freqMin, freqMax)
ppm ← 1e6 × (1- crystalCorrection) 

The ppm number can be inputted into the -C argument of the airspyr2_transfer command (which interfaces with the Airspy to receive radio frequency data) to
correct the frequency offset: 

airspyr2_transfer file.cs8 -f [CENTER_FREQUENCY]-s 1536000000 -C [PPM]  

The last step is converting file.cs8, which is a collection of complex 8-bit signed integer samples, into IQ data. The conversion can be performed with the
following code snippet:

buffer = open(file.cs8, type=int8)
buffer = buffer [::2] + 1j × buffer[1::2] 

The DeFli Drone Detection device is built for OcuSync drone ID detection by Airmine Inc and consists of. 

A Chewy Larkbox X (Intel N100), two Airspy R2's and two Altelix 2.4 GHz omni-directional antennas. 

One Airspy hops to a different center frequency on the 2.4 GHz frequency band and another Airspy hops to a different
center frequency on the 5.8 GHz frequency band. Each capture consists of 1,500,000 complex 8-bit signedintegers samples, which are enough samples to potentially
contain a drone ID. 

Fig. 13 shows the script output of a detected Mavic 2 drone. In this instance, a drone ID version 2 packet is picked up and properly decoded. The script prints out the
raw bytes of the deframed drone ID and JSON data of the packet data points. The script properly parses the serial number, GPS coordinates of the drone, altitude, height,
speeds, yaw, GPS accuracy (pilot GPS clock), GPS coordinates of the pilot, GPS coordinates of the return-to- home location and UUID. The serial number and UUID
have been concealed for the sake of privacy.

Fig. 14 shows the drone control panel web application built in Flask. The Flask application listens for JSON requests and displays nine detection attributes: model,
serial number, UUID, altitude, height, yaw, drone location, pilot location and timestamp

*Enhanced WiFi Detection* 

A DJI Enhanced Wi-Fi detection system can be achieved by only using network adapters with monitor mode and custom clock rate capabilities.
The Department 13 white paper revealed that DJI drones use Atheros chips to broadcast beacon frames that contain drone IDs. The beacon frames are emitted with
a bandwidth of 5 MHz. This is typically not allowed for normal network interface cards; however, Atheros network interface cards are able to be clocked at half rate
(10 MHz) or quarter rate (5 MHz) [2].

DeFli Drone Detection Devices use both the Intel 8265 WIFi Card and the USB connected with SMA Output Panda (PAU06) 

Both these  interface card can also be used by Kismet, a wireless network device detector and sniffer that operates on Wi-Fi interfaces. 

The following command allows Kismet to scan Wi-Fi channel 1 through 177 (consisting both 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz frequencies) at a 5 MHz bandwidth: 

kismet -c adapter:channels = “1W5, 2W5,
3W5, 4W5, 5W5, 6W5, 7W5, 8W5, 9W5, 10W5,
11W5, 12W5, 13W5, 14W5, 140W5, 149W5,
153W5, 157W5, 161W5, 165W5, 169W5, 173W5,
177W5” 

The Kismet control panel allows users to filter Wi-Fi devices based upon MAC address, advertised SSID or beacon vendor tag. The best way to detect DJI drones is by filtering individualized 802.11 vendor tags. IEEE keeps
an open-source record of all registered company 802.11 vendor tags. DJI vendor tags are the following:
• 60-60-1F
• 34-D2-62
• 48-1C-B9 

By extension, Kismet supports non-DJI drone detection such as Parrot. Parrot vendor tags are the following:
• 00-12-1C
• 90-03-B7
• A0-14-3D
• 00-26-7E
